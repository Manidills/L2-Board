#### Overview

L2-Board is an advanced analytics dashboard designed to provide comprehensive insights into the BNB Chain's Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem. Our platform leverages AI agents built with large language models (LLMs) that are continuously trained and refined over time. These AI agents extract, verify, interact, and summarize data across multiple L2 solutions, offering users real-time, actionable insights. Built with the needs of developers, investors, and blockchain enthusiasts in mind, L2-Board delivers a holistic view of the L2 landscape, addressing key metrics such as TVL, transaction volumes, and more.
